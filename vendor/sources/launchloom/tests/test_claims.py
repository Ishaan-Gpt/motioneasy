"""Claims QA: nothing reaches a reader that the operator did not approve.

Every other test here checks a behaviour. This one checks the promise — across
enough generated briefs that a leak cannot hide behind the one fixture everybody
looks at. Each brief carries deliberately withheld features and private evidence
notes, and every surface of the export is read back and searched for them.
