# Dependencies and references

Original Launchloom code is Apache-2.0. That does **not** relicense dependencies,
model outputs, media, or a separately operated Postiz installation.

| Pydantic | Python dependency | MIT |
| Uvicorn | Python dependency | BSD-3-Clause |

| FFmpeg / ffprobe | System command; no binaries in this ZIP | Build-dependent LGPL/GPL obligations |
| libx264 | Used when the installed FFmpeg supports it | GPL / applicable commercial terms |
| Postiz | Optional independent HTTP service; source is not copied | AGPL-3.0 for its OSS; hosted service terms separately |
| ComfyUI | Optional independent HTTP service | Project, custom-node, model and output licenses separately |
| fal | Optional hosted model API | Provider and selected model terms; not an OSS dependency |

Screen Studio is a reference for interaction, not a dependency or unofficial API.
Openscreen is an MIT-licensed reference candidate; its code is not integrated or
vendored. Remotion is not a dependency; do not assume its organization/rendering
use is universally free. Inspect actual distribution/build obligations before
shipping a desktop bundle or container image commercially. This is not a license
audit or legal clearance.

## docker/chromium-seccomp.json

Chromium-compatible Docker seccomp profile, taken from the Playwright repository
(`utils/docker/seccomp_profile.json`, microsoft/playwright, Apache-2.0). It keeps
container syscall filtering default-deny while permitting the user-namespace calls
Chromium's own sandbox requires. Without it, Docker's default profile forces the
operator to choose between `CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX=1` and `seccomp=unconfined`.
