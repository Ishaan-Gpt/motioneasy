"""One command that proves whether Launchloom works on this machine.

`python -m launchloom selftest` checks the environment, produces a real launch kit
from the bundled sample, inspects what came out, and writes a report the operator
can paste into an issue without having to describe anything themselves.

It runs the actual pipeline — not a simulation of it — in a temporary directory,
and touches nothing else. No network, no account, no API key.
