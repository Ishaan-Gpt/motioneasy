# Quiet Cinema

Launchloom's visual system is **Quiet Cinema**: calm editorial surfaces around one vivid product stage.

Scope: the public pages (`homepage/`), the generated launch-kit landing pages and
the film renderer. The local studio, production board and preview editor now use
[Obsidian](OBSIDIAN.md), which is layered over this system's stylesheet; the
principles below still govern what those surfaces are allowed to claim.

## Principles

1. **The product is the image.** Real recordings and rendered outputs lead; decoration does not.
2. **One focal stage.** Use a warm paper canvas (`#F6F5F0`) and a single deep-charcoal stage (`#171A17`) for the current film or product moment.
3. **One accent family.** Default accent is restrained vermilion (`#A83B2F`). Existing approved brand colors may override it.
4. **Fewer containers.** Prefer spacing, rules and typography over repeated same-shape cards.
5. **Purpose before implementation.** Say “Product / actual behavior” before “Recording”, and “Motion / type & movement” before “After Effects”.
6. **Motion earns attention.** Animate the product transition that explains value; keep surrounding UI still. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
7. **No fake evidence.** Concept visuals must never be presented as implemented product behavior. Preserve the existing capability/verification labels.

## Defaults

| Token | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Paper | `#F6F5F0` |
| Ink | `#20251F` |
| Product stage | `#171A17` |
| Accent | `#A83B2F` |
| Body copy | 16–18px on public pages; readable 14–16px in the studio |
| Radius | 8px controls, 12px surfaces, 16px product stage |

Avoid blue-purple gradients, glowing AI orbs, decorative particles, glass-everywhere UI, card walls, and staggered fade-ins by default.

## Launchloom application

- The **film/player** is the hero surface in the studio.
- The production board reads as a **shot list**, not a dashboard of cards.
- Final-film review uses the dark stage; import/version controls stay on paper.
- Publication drafts are separated by rules rather than a dense grid of equal cards.
- Public pages stay mostly warm and bright; the actual film frame carries the dark cinematic contrast.

Accessibility, publication approval, provider consent, rights confirmation and security behavior are functional requirements and override visual preference.
