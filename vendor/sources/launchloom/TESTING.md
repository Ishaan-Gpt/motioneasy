# Testing this

Everything below has only ever been run by one person, on one Mac, plus a Linux
container and a CI runner. That is the honest limit of what
[docs/VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md) can claim, and the fastest way to
move it is someone else's machine.

## The two-minute version

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom.git && cd Launchloom
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e . && python -m playwright install chromium
python -m launchloom selftest
```

`selftest` runs the real pipeline — it drives the bundled app in a browser,
records it, renders both cuts, writes a landing page and a kit, then checks what
came out. It works in a temporary directory, touches nothing else, and needs no
account, no API key and no network.

It takes about twenty seconds and writes `launchloom-selftest.txt`. That file is
the report: paste it into
[a tester report](https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom/issues/new?template=tester-report.yml)
and you are done.

Add `--keep ./out` if you want the films and the kit left somewhere you can open
them. **Please do open them.** The automated checks can tell you a file decodes;
only a person can tell you it looks wrong.

## Without installing anything

If Docker is easier than a Python environment:

```bash
docker run --rm -e CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX=1 ghcr.io/forifor/launchloom \
  python -m launchloom selftest
```

The image carries both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so this runs on an Intel
box and on an Apple Silicon Mac alike — both were pulled and run before this was
written. About twenty seconds, then copy the report out of the terminal.

Two honest caveats. `CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX=1` turns off Chromium's own sandbox,
which is acceptable here because the selftest only ever loads HTML the image
already contains, in a container you are about to throw away — for recording
anything of your own, use `docker compose up`, which keeps both the container's
seccomp filter and Chromium's sandbox. And a container is Linux: it tells me
nothing about whether Launchloom works on **your** operating system, which is the
thing I most need to know.

### Or in a browser, with nothing installed

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/FORIFOR/Launchloom)

The devcontainer installs FFmpeg, Chromium and the package for you, then prints
the two commands worth running. The recipe was verified by running it in the same
base image Codespaces uses: all eight checks passed in 20.3s, with
`CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX=1`, which a Codespace needs because it cannot supply the
seccomp profile Chromium's sandbox requires.

## What would help most, in order

1. **[Windows](https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom/issues/5).** Never run. Fonts, FFmpeg on PATH, the Playwright
   browser, and whether the film comes out with readable Japanese and Latin text.
2. **[A Linux desktop](https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom/issues/6).** The container works on both
   architectures; a desktop session with real fonts and a real screen-share
   permission dialog has not been tried.
3. **[A real publish through Postiz](https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom/issues/7)**, on an account you own. The integration is
   implemented and contract-tested, but no live social account has ever been
   used. The receipt, and the remote state read back afterwards, are what I have
   never seen. Live publishing is off by default and every post needs an explicit
   approval, so nothing can go out by accident.
4. **Your own product, not the sample.** Record a staging URL you control, or
   import a screen recording you already have. Whether the camera work and the
   copy make sense for something that is not Orbit is genuinely unknown.
5. **A paid generation endpoint.** fal and ComfyUI are contract-tested only. If
   you run one, the thing I want to know is what happens when it fails halfway.

## What you should not do

- Do not point capture at a production environment, or at anything holding real
  customer data. Use a staging environment with test data. The browser gets a
  fresh context and inherits no cookies, but DOM masking is not a guarantee.
- Do not expose the studio to the internet. The authentication is one token for
  one operator.

## If it breaks

That is the more useful outcome, and it is what the report is for. Paste
whatever the terminal printed. `python -m launchloom doctor` on its own is also
useful — it launches the browser and resolves the render fonts rather than
checking that files exist, which is how several environment problems have turned
out to be visible before a build ever starts.

## If you would rather write code

Two issues are scoped so that nothing else has to be understood first:

- [Add a third language to the studio](https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom/issues/3) — one table in one file,
  with three tests already guarding it.
- [A fourth visual direction for the film](https://github.com/FORIFOR/Launchloom/issues/4) — ground, ink and
  structure, not an accent colour.
